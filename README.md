# Hi there, I'm Nils Wentzell

I am a Research Scientist at the [Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics/) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). My work revolves around developing and implementing cutting-edge computational techniques to tackle the quantum many-body problem in condensed matter physics. I specialize in various numerical methods, including Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, Continuous-time Quantum Monte Carlo, Exact Diagonalization, Functional Renormalization Group, and Diagrammatic Perturbation Theory. Additionally, I am passionate about modern open-source software development, particularly using C++ and Python, with a strong emphasis on high-performance computing and parallel programming. Currently, I lead the development of the [TRIQS](https://triqs.github.io/triqs/latest/) open-source software library at CCQ. I obtained my M.Sc. in physics from RWTH Aachen University and my Ph.D. from the University of TÃ¼bingen in Germany.
